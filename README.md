# odin-recipes
Setting up my first html document using Git, Github & VScode 

This should help with building the foundations of creating a website and using all the correct tools to make it happen 

The project is a recipe webpage, only written in HTML and should demonstrate an ability to click different links that will lead to different recipes on the same webpage or in another tab.
